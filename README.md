### Summary

This repository documents the planning, coordination, and execution of the end-to-end operational relocation of a sensitive asset. This was a complex, **First-of-its-Kind (FOAK)** asset relocation requiring coordination with NAVSEA, DOE, and NRC regulatory bodies.

### Project Goals

*   Safely relocate a vital nuclear training asset across multiple jurisdictions.
*   Ensure zero incidents or environmental releases during the move.
*   Validate compliance with rigorous seismic and engineering standards during execution.

### Key Learnings & Achievements

*   **Multi-Agency Coordination:** Successfully managed stakeholders and compliance requirements across divergent regulatory frameworks (NAVSEA, DOE, NRC).
*   **Seismic Standard Adherence:** Ensured stringent adherence to **ASCE 4/43 Seismic Standards** for structural integrity validation.
*   **Project Management:** Demonstrated high-stakes project execution capability with zero incidents over the duration of the complex move.
